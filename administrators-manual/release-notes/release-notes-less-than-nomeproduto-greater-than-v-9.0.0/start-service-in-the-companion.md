# Start Service in the Companion

A new command has been added to enable the restart of services in case of communication loss of the application. Access the Messages screen on the Portal, click on “New Message”, and send the message: “start\_services” to the affected devices. When the application receives the push with the command, it will initialize the application's processes, activate the application's alarms, and send the relevant application information, including Device Info, Usage, Site, and SMS.
