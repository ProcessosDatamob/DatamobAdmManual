# Report Non-Compliance of Permissions

When accessing the "Devices" menu, clicking on "Device List" and on the "Device Information" icon, a new "Permissions" section has been added, containing the list and status of system permissions to identify any non-compliance that may arise. And when one of the permissions in the managed settings, which is not optional, has the status "disabled" in the list received from the device, the system will display the "In Compliance" field with the value "No".
