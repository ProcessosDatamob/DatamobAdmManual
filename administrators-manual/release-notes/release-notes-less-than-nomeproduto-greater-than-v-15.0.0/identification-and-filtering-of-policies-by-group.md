# Identification and Filtering of Policies by Group

Now, the system allows identifying and filtering policies by groups, improving policy management in the portal. In the "Manage Policy" screen, a new "Group" column has been added, displaying the group linked to each policy. Additionally, a "Group" filter has been implemented, allowing group users to filter policies linked to their groups, while company users can filter by all registered groups. This feature enhances the organization and visualization of policies.\
For more information, refer to the Manage Policies section.
