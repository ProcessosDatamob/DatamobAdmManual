# Group Linking in Policies

It is now possible to link policies to groups. Company administrators can create or copy policies with the option to link them to any existing group, while group administrators are required to select a group. Additionally, the system locks any changes to the group link after the policy is linked, preserving the integrity of the associations. This feature enhances the organization and management of policies within the portal.\
