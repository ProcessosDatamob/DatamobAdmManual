# Filter by IMEI and Serial Number in the Location Tab

Now, the system allows more precise filtering in the "Device Location" and "Location History" screens. Users can search for locations directly by the IMEI or Serial Number of the device, providing more focused search results. The "User" filter has been removed from these screens to simplify the search experience and focus on the essential data.\
For more information, refer to the Device Location and Location History sections.
