# Policy Management by Group Administrators

Now, group administrators can directly modify policies through the portal, enabling more decentralized management. In the Device List, by accessing the "Change Policy" option, it will be possible to select policies linked to the administrator's groups or company policies without group associations. The system also restricts access to editing policies linked to groups outside of the administrator's management, ensuring security and control over permissions. This improvement streamlines policy management across different access levels.\
