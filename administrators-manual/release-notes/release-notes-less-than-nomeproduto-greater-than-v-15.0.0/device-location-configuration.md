# Device Location Configuration

Now, the system allows you to configure and manage the location of devices directly from the portal. In the "Manage Device" screen, you can select the device's location by name or address, and it will automatically calculate the distance from the last recorded location to the configured location. This information can also be displayed in the "Device List" through new columns "Location" and "Distance from Location." An additional filter allows you to segment devices based on specific distances, such as up to 100 meters, 300 meters, or over 500 meters, making geographic management of devices easier.\
For more information, refer to the Device List and Device Management Options sections.
