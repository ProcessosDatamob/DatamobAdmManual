# Batch Creation of Device Groups

On the "Manage Groups" screen, the "Batch Registration" option has been created, where it is possible to download a template file to be filled with information about the groups and devices linked to these groups. After filling in the template, it is possible to import this file. At this point, the batch registration of the specified groups and devices will be performed.
