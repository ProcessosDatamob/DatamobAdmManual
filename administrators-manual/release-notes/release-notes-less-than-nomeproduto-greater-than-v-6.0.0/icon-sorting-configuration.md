# Icon Sorting Configuration

In the policy editing screen with Kiosk Mode active, a new Kiosk Mode configuration has been added, allowing you to set the "Icon Sorting" on the device screen to the following options: "User-defined," "By name," or "By installation date." With this configuration, you can improve the visualization and location of icons in Kiosk Mode.
