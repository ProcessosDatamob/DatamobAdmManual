# New Column with "Package Name" Information

In the "Policy Editing" screen, a column with the "Package Name" of the application has been added to the list in the "Applications" tab and in the lists of applications within the "Add Applications" option. This makes it easier to identify the application that will be displayed or installed on the device.
