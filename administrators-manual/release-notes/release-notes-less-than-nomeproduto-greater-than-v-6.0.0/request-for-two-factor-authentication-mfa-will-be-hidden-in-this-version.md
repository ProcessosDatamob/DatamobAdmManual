# Request for Two-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Will be hidden in this version)

Now the system has two-factor authentication to access the Portal. When the user logs out or their session expires, upon entering credentials on the login screen again, the system will send an email with a confirmation code to the user. The system will request the entry of the confirmation code to grant access to the administration portal. The user must correctly enter the 6-digit code or they will not be able to access the Portal again.
