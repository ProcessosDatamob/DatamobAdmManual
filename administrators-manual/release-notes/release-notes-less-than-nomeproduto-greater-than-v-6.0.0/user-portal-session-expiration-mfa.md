# User Portal Session Expiration (MFA)

On the "Companies > General Settings" screen, a field has been added to define the "User Inactivity Timeout" in the system. The default setting is 30 minutes, but it can be reduced to as low as 5 minutes.\
Once the defined timeout is exceeded without any activity on the portal, the system automatically logs out the user and displays a message informing that the session has expired.
