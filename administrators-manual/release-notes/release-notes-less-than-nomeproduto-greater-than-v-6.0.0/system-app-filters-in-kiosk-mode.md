# System App Filters in Kiosk Mode

In the policy editing screen with Kiosk Mode activated, upon accessing the list of "System Apps," two new filters, "Manufacturer" and "Device," have been added. With these new filters, it's possible to list only the system apps from a specific manufacturer or device, facilitating the configuration of which apps will be displayed in Kiosk Mode on the devices.
