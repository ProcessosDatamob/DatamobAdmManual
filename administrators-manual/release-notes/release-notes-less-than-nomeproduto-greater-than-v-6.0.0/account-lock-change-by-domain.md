# Account Lock Change by Domain

On the "Settings > Manage Policies > Edit Policy" screen, in the "Settings" tab, the option "Account types with management disabled" has been removed from the "User" settings and included in the "Security" settings. The behavior of the configuration will remain the same, blocking the creation of accounts from all specified domains and allowing the creation of accounts from any other domain.
