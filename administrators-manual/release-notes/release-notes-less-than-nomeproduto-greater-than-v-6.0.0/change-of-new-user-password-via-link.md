# Change of New User Password via Link

Upon confirming the registration of a new administrator user on the Portal, the system will send an email to the user containing a link. This link redirects to a screen where the user must set their access password.&#x20;

After registration, the user can log in normally to the Portal.&#x20;

With this new password creation flow, the password field will not be displayed on the user registration screen but will be retained in the editing of an existing registration.
