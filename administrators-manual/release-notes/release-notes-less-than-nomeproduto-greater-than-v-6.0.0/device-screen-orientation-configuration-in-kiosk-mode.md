# Device Screen Orientation Configuration in Kiosk Mode

In the policy editing screen with Kiosk Mode active, a new Kiosk Mode configuration has been added that allows you to set the device screen orientation to "Vertical," "Horizontal," or "User-defined." With this configuration, you can adjust the screen orientation to the one that best suits the device and the defined wallpaper.
