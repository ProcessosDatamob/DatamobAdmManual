# Wallpaper Image Layout Configuration in Kiosk Mode

In the policy editing screen with Kiosk Mode active, a new Kiosk Mode configuration has been added, allowing you to set the "Image Positioning" of the device wallpaper to either "Centered" or "Expanded." With this configuration, you can position the wallpaper image in a way that it is better suited to the device screen.
