# New Registration Filters in Audit

In the Audit screen, a new "Acceptance" activity filter has been created, allowing for the listing of records of acceptances and refusals of terms and policies on the portal and device. To make a more specific filter of acceptances, categories such as Company, Device, and User have also been included.
