# New Company Selection Functionality at Login

Now, when accessing the portal, if the user is linked to more than one company with the same CNPJ, the system will display a selection field based on the registered Plan and Name for each company. After selecting the desired company, the portal will automatically update to display the specific information for that company, such as licenses and associated devices. Additionally, the user can switch between linked companies directly in the portal, without needing to log out, providing a more efficient, practical, and personalized management of each organization's data.\
For more information, refer to the Dashboard section.
