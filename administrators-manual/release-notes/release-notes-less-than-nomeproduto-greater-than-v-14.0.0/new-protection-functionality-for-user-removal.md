# New Protection Functionality for User Removal

Now, the system allows the same email to be registered as an administrator for two different companies, as long as they have the same CNPJ. When attempting to remove a user linked to more than one company, and who is the only administrator in one of those companies, the system will prevent the removal. This functionality ensures that each company maintains at least one active user, preventing accidental deletions that could compromise the company's administration.\
For more information, refer to the Manage Administrator Users section.
