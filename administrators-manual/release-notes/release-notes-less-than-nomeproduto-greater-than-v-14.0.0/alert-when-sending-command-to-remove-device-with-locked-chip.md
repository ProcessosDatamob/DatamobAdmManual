# Alert when sending Command to Remove Device with Locked CHIP

Now, when sending a command to "Remove Device" for a device with the "Android - Block SIM" policy that has the CHIP locked, the system will display a message alerting the administrator that the CHIP is locked. This action ensures that administrators are notified about the possibility of the CHIP remaining locked if the unlock is not performed.\
For more information, refer to the Device Management Options section.
