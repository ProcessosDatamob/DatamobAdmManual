# Restriction of App Operation by Schedule

Allows defining restrictions on app operation by schedule. This option is available on the Policy Editing screen, in the Applications tab, where a column for "Operational Restrictions" has been added. By enabling restrictions in "Enable Restrictions," it is possible to set the operating hours for each day of the week and/or restrict operation throughout the entire day.
