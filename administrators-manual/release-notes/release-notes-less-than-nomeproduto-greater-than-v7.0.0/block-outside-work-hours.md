# Block Outside Work Hours

On the "Edit Policy" screen, in the Settings tab, the "Work" configuration has been added with the function "Block device outside working hours". This feature allows defining the work days (start day and end day) and working hours (start time and end time). With this block, the user won't be able to use Google Play-installed apps on the device.
