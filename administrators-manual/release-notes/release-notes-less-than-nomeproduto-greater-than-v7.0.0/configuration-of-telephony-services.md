# Configuration of Telephony Services

On the "Edit Policy" screen, when kiosk mode is enabled, the option to activate telephony services has been added. This allows the use of phone functionalities by selecting between the options: Active or Set by the Device. When set to "Active" and the policy is saved, the system will send the telephony service packages to the device within the policy and Kiosk, allowing the device to make and receive calls. When set to "Set by the Device," the device will operate according to its default configuration, with or without the services.
