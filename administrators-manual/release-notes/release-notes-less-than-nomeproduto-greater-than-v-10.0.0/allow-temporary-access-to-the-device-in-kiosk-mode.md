# Allow Temporary Access to the Device in Kiosk Mode

In the "Kiosk Mode" menu, the "Temporary Device Access" option has been added. This feature allows administrators to configure temporary access to the device, enabling users to perform important actions outside of Kiosk Mode for a predefined period, with options of 5 minutes (default), 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.&#x20;

To access the password, go to the "Device List" and click on the "More Information" icon. There, you can access the password, copy it, and see the remaining time until it expires. Once the time expires, the password will be updated.&#x20;

This feature ensures that devices can be temporarily unlocked for necessary actions while maintaining the control and security provided by Kiosk Mode.
