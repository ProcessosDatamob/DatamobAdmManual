# Add Manual Applications to the Policy

This feature allows company administrators to add manual applications to a policy, whether Kiosk Mode is activated or not, enabling approving or blocking  applications that are not available on Google Play.&#x20;

The system will add the application to the list of applications with the source 'Manual' and the installation type 'Available', and allows changing the installation type of the application between the following options: Available, Pre-installed, Forced Installation, and Blocked. The application will be sent to the device with the defined installation type when the policy is saved.
