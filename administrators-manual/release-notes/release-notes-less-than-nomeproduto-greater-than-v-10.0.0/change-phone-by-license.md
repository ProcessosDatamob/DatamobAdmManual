# Change Phone by License

A change has been made to allow identifying devices by license instead of the phone number. This change facilitates the understanding and management of device information. The change has been implemented on the following screens:

* Devices without Communication
* Data Consumption
* SMS Consumption
* Contracted Licenses
* Manage Groups
* Register New Group
* Applications > Users with Application
* Remote Application Installation > Application Delivery Details
* Consumption Profile > User Tab
* Device List
* Non-Compliance Report
* Manage Device
* Device Information
* Sites Report by URL or Keyword
* Messages > Message Details
* Share Documents > Sharing Details
* Device Location
* Location History In the generated reports, the field that was "Phone" will now also be displayed as "License."
