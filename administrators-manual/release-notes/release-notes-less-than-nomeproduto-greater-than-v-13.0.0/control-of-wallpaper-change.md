# Control of Wallpaper Change

We made adjustments to the "Screen" configuration, specifically in the "Disable Wallpaper Change" option. Now, when this option is enabled, the settings related to "Set Wallpaper" will be automatically disabled. Additionally, we updated the description to clarify that with the wallpaper change disabled, the current wallpaper of the device will remain unchanged, with no possibility of modification or sending a new image.

This version aims for greater fluidity and clarity.
