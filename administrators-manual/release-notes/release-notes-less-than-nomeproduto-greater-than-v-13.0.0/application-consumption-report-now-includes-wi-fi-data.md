# Application Consumption Report Now Includes Wi-Fi Data

We have implemented a Wi-Fi data consumption report by applications in the portal, allowing for a detailed analysis of Wi-Fi data usage on the company's devices. Now, when accessing **Devices > Application Information**, the system displays a new column titled "Wi-Fi Data" next to the "Mobile Data" column, showing the Wi-Fi data consumption for the current cycle.

Additionally, this information is also available in the user list with applications and in the list of applications for specific devices.

**Important:** Wi-Fi consumption information will not be available in previous versions of the app.

For more information, refer to the [Application Information](../../portal/dispositivos/application-information.md) section.
