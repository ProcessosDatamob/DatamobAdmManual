# New Total Data Usage Graph

A new Total Data Usage graph has been implemented on the portal Dashboard. This donut-shaped graph provides a clear view of data consumption distribution across devices, including:

* Local Mobile Data: Displays total mobile data usage.
* Wi-Fi Data: Shows total data usage via Wi-Fi.
* Roaming Mobile Data (when applicable): Displays mobile data usage during roaming.

The functionality includes a detailed legend and a text box that provides additional information, such as percentages and exact values of consumed data, when hovering over the graph.

This new visualization facilitates the analysis and management of data usage by devices, offering a comprehensive and detailed view.

For more information, refer to the [Dashboard](../../portal/dashboard.md) section.
