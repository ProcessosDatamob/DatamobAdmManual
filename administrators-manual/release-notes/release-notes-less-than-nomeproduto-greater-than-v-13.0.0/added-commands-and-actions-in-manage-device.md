# Added Commands and Actions in "Manage Device"

In this version, when accessing the "Manage" option for a device, functionalities will be grouped together. This change allows the administrator to perform centralized management of the entire device. It will be possible to select certain action options based on the current validations of Management Mode or Operating System.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
