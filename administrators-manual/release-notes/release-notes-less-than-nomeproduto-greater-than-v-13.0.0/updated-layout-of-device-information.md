# Updated Layout of Device Information

In this version, we adjusted the layout of the screen that was previously called "Details," and it is now titled "Information." Additionally, we reorganized the information within it to create a more organized layout and to allow the inclusion of as much information as possible.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
