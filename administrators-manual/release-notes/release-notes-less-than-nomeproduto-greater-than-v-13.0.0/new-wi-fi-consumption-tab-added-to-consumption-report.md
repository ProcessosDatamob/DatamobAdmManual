# New Wi-Fi Consumption Tab Added to Consumption Report

The new functionality in the portal allows you to view Wi-Fi data usage for all devices registered within the company. You can now access this information directly on the **Company > Consumption** screen, with the option to generate detailed reports by period.

For more information, refer to the [Consumption](../../portal/empresas/consumos.md) section.
