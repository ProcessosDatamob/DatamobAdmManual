# Restart SIM Lock

Now, it will no longer be necessary to reset the device to re-lock the SIM. Block SIM allows the SIM to be locked again after the removal of the lock, enabling the swapping of the device's SIM and the efficient application of the lock. When the app completes the removal of the SIM lock, it will allow the lock to be applied again.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
