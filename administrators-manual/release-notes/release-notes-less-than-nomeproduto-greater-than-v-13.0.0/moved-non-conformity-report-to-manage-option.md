# Moved Non-Conformity Report to "Manage" Option

Now, when accessing the "Manage" menu for a device, you will see the "Non-Conformities" tab, as we have removed it from the grouped device menu and grouped the functionality under the Device Management menu. This allows the administrator to have more centralized management.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
