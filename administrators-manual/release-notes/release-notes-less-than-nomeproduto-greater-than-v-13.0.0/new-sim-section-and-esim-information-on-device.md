# New "SIM" Section and eSIM Information on Device

A new "SIM" section has been added to the "Manage Device" screen and the "Device Information" for Android devices, grouping detailed information about the SIM and eSIM, such as operator, phone number, ICCID, IMEI, and other details, making it easier to view and manage this information. The related fields have been removed from the "Connectivity" section.

For more information, refer to the [List of Devices](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/device-information.md) and [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) sections.
