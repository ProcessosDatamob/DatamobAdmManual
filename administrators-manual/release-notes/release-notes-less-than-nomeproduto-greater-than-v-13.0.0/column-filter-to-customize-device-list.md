# Column Filter to Customize Device List

In this version, we implemented an icon that allows customization of the Device List. By clicking on the icon, users can filter the columns, search by text, select, and save their preferences for which columns they want to be displayed, customizing the view of their Device List.

For more information, refer to the [List of Devices](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/device-information.md)  section.
