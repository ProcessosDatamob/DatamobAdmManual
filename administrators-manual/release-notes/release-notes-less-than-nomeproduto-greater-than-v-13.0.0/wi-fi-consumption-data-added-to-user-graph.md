# Wi-Fi Consumption Data Added to User Graph

A new feature has been implemented on the portal Dashboard, allowing for a detailed analysis of Wi-Fi data usage by user. Now, when accessing the "Data Usage by User" graph, the system displays tabs to switch between "Mobile Data" and "Wi-Fi," providing a clear view of data consumption for each type of connection.

For more information, refer to the [Dashboard](../../portal/dashboard.md) section.
