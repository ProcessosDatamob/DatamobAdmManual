# Added Geolocation Tab in Device Management

The "Geolocation" option, once found in Location menu, is now a tab placed in "Manage" menu under the Device Management Menu. This allows the administrator to have more centralized management.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
