# Added Quick Access Link to Policy Settings Screen

We have added a quick access link for editing policies to provide administrators with the agility to configure policies without the need to switch between menus.

This link will be available in two locations: when accessing the "Device List" menu in the "Policy" column and in the "Information" tab of the "Manage Device" screen.

For more information, refer to the [List of Devices](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/device-information.md) and [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) sections.
