# Device Lock by Mobile Data Limit

A configuration has been added to lock the device when the mobile data usage limit set in the portal (Consumption Profile) for the current cycle is reached. This hides all applications except for "Phone," "," and "Play Store," ensuring efficient management of mobile data usage by administrators. The configuration name was previously "Work" and is now "Full Lockdown."

For more information, refer to the [Full Lockdown](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/configuracoes-gerais/full-lockdown.md) section.
