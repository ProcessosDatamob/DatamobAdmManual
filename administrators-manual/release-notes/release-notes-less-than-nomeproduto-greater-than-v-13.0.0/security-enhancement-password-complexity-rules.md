# Security Enhancement: Password Complexity Rules

To ensure a higher level of security in accessing the platform, a new password complexity rule has been implemented. Now, administrators can set stricter criteria for creating, changing, and recovering user passwords.

**Complexity Requirements:** When changing a password, users must adhere to new guidelines that include using a more robust combination of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).

**Enhanced Security:** This update provides more effective protection against unauthorized access, aligning with best practices in digital security.

These changes are essential for increasing access security and protecting user data more effectively.
