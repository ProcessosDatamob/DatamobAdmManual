# New Kiosk Application - Mob Settings

We are launching a new application developed for Kiosk Mode, called Mob Settings. With this app, users will have more comprehensive control over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and screen management.

The Mob Settings app is already available on the Play Store.

For more information, refer to the [Mob Settings](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/aplicativos/mob-settings.md) section.
