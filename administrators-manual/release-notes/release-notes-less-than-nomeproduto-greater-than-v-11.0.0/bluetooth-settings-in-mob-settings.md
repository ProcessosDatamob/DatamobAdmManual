# Bluetooth Settings in Mob Settings

Mob Settings now allows administrators to configure the Bluetooth settings of devices without needing to access all device settings. After installing Mob Settings and activating the managed Bluetooth configuration, when the application is opened, the system will display the button to access Bluetooth settings. Clicking the button will open the Bluetooth configuration screen, where the app will request the necessary permissions to use the settings.

On the configuration screen, the user will be able to:

* Enable and disable Bluetooth on the device.
* Activate the device's visibility via Bluetooth for other devices, with visibility automatically turned off after the visibility period ends.
* Display a list of all available Bluetooth devices to connect to, with the list updating every 10 seconds while the screen is accessed.
* Pair the device with an available Bluetooth device.

For more information, refer to the [Mob Settings](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/aplicativos/mob-settings.md) section.
