# Added Function to Change Wallpaper on the Device Screen

In the policy settings, we have added a new function that allows you to set the wallpaper for the device screen. Previously, this functionality was only available on devices in kiosk mode.

For more information, refer to the [Screen](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/configuracoes-gerais/screen.md) section.
