# Display Settings in Mob Settings

Mob Settings now allows administrators to configure the display settings of devices without needing to access all device settings. After installing Mob Settings and activating the managed display configuration, when the application is opened, the system will display the button to access display settings. Clicking the button will open the display configuration screen, where the app will request the necessary permissions to use the settings.

On the configuration screen, the user will be able to:

* Enable and disable adaptive brightness for the screen.
* Increase and decrease the screen brightness.
* Enable and disable locking the current screen orientation.
* Select the timeout duration for the automatic screen shutdown, with the following options: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 30 minutes.

For more information, refer to the [Mob Settings](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/aplicativos/mob-settings.md) section.
