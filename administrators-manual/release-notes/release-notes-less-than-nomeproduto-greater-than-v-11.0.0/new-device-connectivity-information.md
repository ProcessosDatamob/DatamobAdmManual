# New Device Connectivity Information

When accessing a device through the portal, the administrator will now see a new field called "Connectivity," which will store information about the device's telephony and connectivity, such as phone number, IMEI, and even the Wi-Fi network to which the device is connected.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
