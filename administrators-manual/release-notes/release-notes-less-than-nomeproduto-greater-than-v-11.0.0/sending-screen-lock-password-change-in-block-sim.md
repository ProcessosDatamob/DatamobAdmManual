# Sending Screen Lock Password Change in Block SIM

The functionality for configuring and sending a screen lock password change for Block SIM has been implemented, allowing administrators to remotely change the screen lock password on devices. This functionality only alters the Block SIM screen lock, without affecting the device's overall screen lock password. Previously, this change could only be made directly in the Block SIM app.

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
