# New Menus When Accessing a Device

With the aim of unifying device information, we have moved some tabs that were previously available by clicking on "More Information" for a device into the device's menu.

**L**ist of menus that have been relocated into the device details:

* Device Applications
* Battery History
* Storage History (Free Storage)

For more information, refer to the [Device Management Options](../../portal/dispositivos/list-of-devices/opcoes-de-gerenciamento-de-dispositivos.md) section.
