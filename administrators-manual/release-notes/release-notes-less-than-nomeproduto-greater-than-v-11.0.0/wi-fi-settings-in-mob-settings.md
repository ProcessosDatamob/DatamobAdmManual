# Wi-Fi Settings in Mob Settings

Mob Settings now allows administrators to centrally control the Wi-Fi settings of devices, simplifying access to and management of wireless connections.

After installing Mob Settings and activating the managed Wi-Fi configuration, when the application is opened, the system will display the button to access the Wi-Fi settings. Clicking the button will bring up the current Wi-Fi configuration screen of Mob Settings, where the app will request the necessary permissions to utilize the settings.

For more information, refer to the [Mob Settings](../../portal/configuracoes/editar-politica/aplicativos/mob-settings.md) section.
