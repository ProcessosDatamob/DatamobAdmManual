# MESSAGES AND COMMANDS

The purpose of this system screen is to enable the user to send messages and commands to all the company's devices, to one or more groups or to one or more users of specific devices. Messages and commands are sent via PUSH and do not generate SMS consumption.

To send one or more messages, they are placed in a queue where they are grouped and sent to the device every minute. Depending on the volume of messages to be sent, it may take a while to send them to the device, but no longer than 2 minutes for the messages to leave the queue and be sent.

The messages that can be sent are free text and can contain up to 160 characters.

The commands that can be sent are not available on the Portal, as they perform actions that can affect the operation of the device or application.

Some of the special commands are:

* Logon - Enables logging by the application.&#x20;
* Logoff - Disables logging by the application.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**&#x20;

To restart the services in case of communication loss of the application, click on “New Message”, send the message “start\_services” to the affected devices. When the application receives the push with the command, it will initialize the application's processes, activate the application's alarms, and send the relevant application information, including Device Info, Usage, Site, and SMS.
{% endhint %}

When receiving a command, the application will not display the text of the command sent.

To find out how to send messages and commands, follow the steps described in this section.
