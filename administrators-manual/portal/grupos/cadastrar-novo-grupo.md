2. When you access the screen, the system will not allow you to change the information in the "**Company**" field, as this is essential for the system rules to work correctly.
3. Fill in the name of the group.
4. Click on "**Register**" to finish registering the new group.

Users or Devices that are not linked to any group are listed and can be marked to already be in the new group being registered. It is also possible to search for users to link to the new group.

When you have finished registering, the system will open the group management screen. Read the "Manage Groups" section to find out how to manage the devices linked to a group.
