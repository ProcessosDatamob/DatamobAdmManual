5. To edit a group, click on the three dots on the right of the group line. Choose the "**Edit Group**" option. When editing, you can add or delete users from the group.
6. To delete a group, click on the three dots on the right of the group line. Choose the "**Remove Group**" option.
7. If you wish, you can also copy the data displayed about the groups to the clipboard or generate an Excel spreadsheet with the data.
8. To create groups in batches, which speeds up the creation of large numbers of groups, download the Excel template containing two columns Group and Device, fill it in with the relevant information, save it and import it into the portal (the file must have a maximum limit of 5 MB).

The system will validate the file on import and display the following message if the file does not contain the template information: "_The template file information is invalid, review the file and try again!". Select the "Register New" button to start registering a new group. If the file contains valid information, a message will appear informing you that the import will be processed in the background: "Please wait for the information to be imported! The system will display a notification at the top of the screen when finished, where you can review the import result._"

The system will validate whether the groups entered exist in the company, regardless of whether it is written in lower or upper case letters and will create the groups entered, if they do not exist in the company, even if they have no devices linked to them, it will link the device to the group entered, if: the device exists and the device is not linked to another group.

If the device is registered in another group, it will not only matter for that device

When processing is complete, a notification will appear with the option "**View details**", clicking on which will open a list of errors for checking.

9. Select the "**Register New**" button to start registering a new group.

When you have finished making changes to the group, the system will return to the group administration screen.
