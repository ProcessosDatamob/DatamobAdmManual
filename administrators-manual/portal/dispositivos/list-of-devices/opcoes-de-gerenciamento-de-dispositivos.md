### Disable Device

When you send the Deactivate Devices command, all non-Google applications will be deactivated, phone calls will be allowed and the device status will change to deactivated. To deactivate a device, use the "Deactivate Device" option in the device options menu. This option only appears for devices that are in "Active" status. A confirmation screen will appear.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (218).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on the "Deactivate" button to confirm the operation.

### **Enable Device**

This option only appears for devices that are in "Disabled" status. To activate a disabled device, click on "Activate Device" in the device management options.

Confirm the update by clicking "Activate" in the dialog box, as shown below.

### Turn off device screen

The "Turn Screen Off" option sends a command to turn off the device's screen. When you click on the "Turn off screen" option, the command is executed directly and a message appears on the screen to inform you that the command has been sent to the device.

### Restart device

This operation sends a command to restart the device. Choose the "Restart Device" option. A message is displayed on the portal screen to confirm that the command has been sent.

### **Generate New Screen Lock Password**

This option allows the administrator to set the screen lock password for Block SIM, enabling remote password change. In the Device List, click on "Generate New Screen Lock Password," enter and confirm the new Screen Lock Password using letters, numbers, and symbols. Confirm the password change, and upon confirmation, the command will be sent via push to the Management App for application on the device.

### Remove Screen Lock

This operation sends a command to remove the screen lock from the device. Choose the "Remove Screen Lock" option. A message is displayed on the portal screen to confirm that the command has been sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

This option will only be available for devices activated with Android Block SIM management mode policy.
{% endhint %}

### Generate new device password

The system allows you to generate a new password for the device. To do this, choose the "Generate New Device Password" option as shown in the image below.

Fill in the "New password" and "Confirm new password" fields with the same values so that the "Confirm" button is enabled. Optionally, the following options can be checked as required:

* Do not allow other administrators to change the password again until the user enters it on the device;
* &#x20;Do not ask for user credentials at device startup;&#x20;

Lock the device after the password has been reset.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (219).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
#### NOTE

When selecting the option "Do not request user credentials at device startup," the password will not be requested during the startup process. The password will only be necessary to unlock the device's screen. Secure Boot: The password requested at startup is a security measure implemented by Secure Boot. This functionality protects the startup process from security attacks originating from malicious code, such as malware and ransomware.
{% endhint %}

### **Remove SIM Lock**

This option allows the administrator to send a command to remove the SIM lock from a device, granting user access to the device.

In the "Device List" screen, select the "Android - Block SIM" policy and choose the "Remove SIM Lock" option. The system will display a confirmation message for sending the SIM lock removal command, allowing you to confirm or cancel. After sending the removal command, the device will receive a push notification with the command, and will capture and send the command to Block SIM. The device user needs to click on the push notification or open the Block SIM app to complete the lock removal.

### **Restart SIM Lock**

The "Restart SIM Lock" feature allows the administrator to reapply the SIM lock on a device after it has been removed.

This enables the administrator, following the lock removal, to change the device's SIM and apply a new lock, ensuring flexibility in management and security for managed devices.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**\
After removing the lock, it is possible to reapply a lock without resetting or formatting the device.
{% endhint %}

### Remove Device (WIPE)

This operation allows you to delete a device. It clears the device's data and settings. Deleted devices do not appear in the company's device list. The "Remove Device" option appears in the list of device options on the device list screen ("Devices" menu, "List Devices" option).

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**

A message is displayed on the screen for information and warning. The operation cannot be undone, so only confirm when you are sure you want to delete the device.
{% endhint %}

### **Remove Device with SIM Locked**

When sending the removal command for a device that is activated under an Android Block SIM policy and has a locked SIM, the administrator will be alerted to send a command to remove the SIM lock before removing the device from the portal.

A message will be displayed: **This device may have the SIM lock enabled. Do you want to send a command to remove the "SIM Lock"?**\
By clicking "Yes," the command to remove the SIM lock is sent, and a message will appear: Command sent successfully! Please wait to try removing the device again.

The system will then wait for confirmation before allowing the device removal. The device user needs to click on the push notification or open the Block SIM app to complete the lock removal.

{% hint style="info" %}
The device user needs to click on the push notification or open the Block SIM app to complete the lock removal.
{% endhint %}

If the administrator chooses not to send the command, the following message will be displayed: By removing this device, the mobile data usage of the user's SIM card may be blocked! Do you really want to remove this device? This action cannot be undone.

After opting to send the SIM unlock command and the portal has received confirmation of the SIM lock removal on the device, the system will display the following message: Do you really want to remove this device? This action cannot be undone.

The options "Remove" and "Cancel" will be presented.

This functionality helps prevent potential SIM lock issues that may arise when removing devices from management.

### Managing

Clicking on the "Manage" option will display the Device Management screen.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (212).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
