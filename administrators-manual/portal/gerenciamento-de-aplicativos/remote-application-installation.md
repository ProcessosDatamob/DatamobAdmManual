#### NOTE

The application sent through remote installation is sent with the installation type "Available." Therefore, if the user uninstalls the application, to reinstall it, the administrator will need to send the install application command again via the portal to the device. Currently, this functionality is not available in policies with Kiosk Mode activated. If the package inserted by the user is different from the package of the app available at the download link:

* The notification will remain fixed on the device until it is restarted.
* The app will be automatically removed from the device by Google.
