The screen has standard elements that are similar to other screens in the system. The following items present the management options for this screen and are listed in the previous figure:

1. If you want to find a specific application, type the name of the application in the "Search" field.
2. The list of applications is displayed on the screen, with each line referring to a device.
3. To sort the information displayed, click on the up and down arrows next to each heading (Application Name, Source and Package Name).
4. Clicking on "..." displays the command option for the application.
5. The "Remove Application" command deletes the application from the list. However, it is not possible to remove the application if there are policies linked to it. First, remove the linkage of the policies in order to remove the application.
6. To generate the application report, click on the "Excel" option. The system can generate a report with only the information on the first page or a complete report. Click on the desired option for the system to start processing.

If it is a one-page report, it is generated and downloaded automatically. If it's a full report, it may take a few minutes to be generated and made available for download in the system notifications.

7. To copy the information from the list of applications to the clipboard, click on the "**Copy**" button.
