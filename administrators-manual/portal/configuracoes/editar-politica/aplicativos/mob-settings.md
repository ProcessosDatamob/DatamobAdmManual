The Managed Settings for Mob Settings are:

#### **Block Network Forgetting**

When this toggle is enabled, network password forgetting is blocked, meaning the user cannot forget the network password.

#### **Bluetooth Settings**

Mob Settings allows administrators to configure and manage device Bluetooth settings in a simplified manner. This includes enabling or disabling Bluetooth, making the device visible to other devices, and pairing with available Bluetooth devices.

When the Mob Settings app is added to a policy, Bluetooth managed configuration is enabled by default, allowing administrators to turn this functionality on or off as needed.

1. After installing the Mob Settings app on the device, check if the Bluetooth setting is active.
2. Open Mob Settings and click on the Bluetooth settings button to access the specific screen.
3. The app will request the necessary permissions to manage Bluetooth.

On the configuration screen, you can enable/disable Bluetooth, activate device visibility, view available devices, refresh the device list every 10 seconds, and pair with Bluetooth devices.

#### **Display Settings**

With Mob Settings, administrators can adjust various display settings on devices, such as brightness, orientation, and screen timeout.

Similar to Bluetooth, the managed display configuration is made available on the portal when the Mob Settings app is added to the policy. Display configuration is enabled by default, allowing administrators to make adjustments as needed.

1. Ensure the display configuration is active after installing the app.
2. Open Mob Settings and click on the display settings button.
3. The app will request the necessary permissions to adjust display settings.
4. On the configuration screen, you can enable/disable adaptive brightness, adjust screen brightness, lock the current screen orientation, and select the screen timeout duration (options range from 15 seconds to 30 minutes).

#### **Wi-Fi Settings**

Mob Settings also enables administrators to control Wi-Fi settings, making it easy to access and manage wireless connections on devices.

When the Mob Settings app is added to a policy, Wi-Fi managed configuration is enabled by default, allowing administrators to turn this functionality on or off as needed.

1. Verify that Wi-Fi configuration is active after installation.
2. Open Mob Settings and click on the Wi-Fi settings button.
3. The app will request the necessary permissions to adjust Wi-Fi settings.
4. The Wi-Fi configuration screen will display all current Mob Settings functionalities, allowing direct management of Wi-Fi connections.

These features allow administrators to maintain centralized and efficient control over key device settings, simplifying the management process and enhancing the usability and security of mobile devices within the organization.
