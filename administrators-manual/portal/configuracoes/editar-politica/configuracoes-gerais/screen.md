Thus:</p><ul><li>With the toggle ON, wallpaper change is DISABLED, meaning the current device wallpaper will be maintained, and it will not be possible to change or upload a new wallpaper image.</li><li>With the toggle OFF, wallpaper change is ENABLED. The current wallpaper will be set to the one configured in the portal, allowing changes or the upload of a new wallpaper image.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Set Wallpaper</td><td>Allows uploading a wallpaper image that will be sent to the device.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**NOTE**\
If Kiosk Mode is enabled in the policy and a wallpaper is set in Kiosk Mode, all devices under this policy will receive the wallpaper configured in Kiosk Mode, which will overwrite the wallpaper set in the "Display" option.

When Kiosk Mode is disabled, the wallpaper reverts to the one configured outside of Kiosk Mode, in the "Display" option.
