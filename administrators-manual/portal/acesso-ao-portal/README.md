# Portal Access

**Access Levels to the Portal**\
The Administration Portal has two access levels:

* **Portal Administrator:** This level provides full access to information and allows setting lock policies for devices.
* **Group Administrator:** This level grants access to data within their group and allows sending messages to the group.

For information on how to create a portal or group administrator, refer to the “Initial Settings and Levels” section.
