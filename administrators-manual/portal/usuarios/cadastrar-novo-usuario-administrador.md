When you access the screen, the system will not allow you to change the information in the "**Company**" field, as this is essential for the system rules to work correctly. Proceed with the following steps:

1. Fill in the user name.
2. If necessary, enter an identification code for the user.
3. Enter the e-mail address that will be used for the user to access the system (examples: carina@teste.com, jose@app.com.br, jonas@tecnologia.com.br). This e-mail address must not be used by any other user in the company.
4. Enter a password for the user.

* **Company Manager** - User who manages the company.

If you are a group leader, more options will be displayed:

7. Click on the "**Register**" button to finish registering the user.
